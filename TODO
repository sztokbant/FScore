TECHNICAL DEBTS

Code smells:
* MatchList.onCreateContextMenu()
* MatchList: Convert MenuItem's "Magic Numbers" into enums
* SingleMatch.onCreateContextMenu()
* SingleMatch.onActivityResult()
* SingleMatch: Convert MenuItem's "Magic Numbers" into enums

Interface:
* Order of players right after adding a new player differs from right after loading a match

TODO for 1st ALPHA
- activity to list/add/delete Round's PlayerRounds
- activity to edit PlayerRound's details
- methods to calculate each Player's points for Round and Match
