TECHNICAL DEBTS

Refactor it!
* Convert MenuItem's "Magic Numbers" into enums for:
  MatchList
  SingleMatch
  SingleRound
* I18n for hard-coded strings

Code smells:
* MatchList.onCreateContextMenu()
* SingleMatch.onCreateContextMenu()
* SingleMatch.onActivityResult()

KNOWN ISSUES
* deleting a Player that belongs to a PlayerRound crashed the app
* Order of players right after adding a new player differs from right after loading a match
* Facebook-only contacts don't get added to Match
* DataManager.saveRound() doesn't seem to be working properly when called from outside DataManager

"GHOST" ISSUES
* intermitent 'SQLiteException: unable to close due to unfinalised statements' upon running test suite (testSaveAnExistingMatchAfterRemovingARound)

TODO for 1st ALPHA
- activity to edit PlayerRound's details
- methods to calculate each Player's points for Round and Match
- fix known issues above
