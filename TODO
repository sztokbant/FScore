TECHNICAL DEBTS

Refactor it!
* DataManagerTest may be cleaned up
* Convert MenuItem's "Magic Numbers" into enums for:
  MatchList
  SingleMatch
  SingleRound

KNOWN ISSUES
* DataManager.saveRound() doesn't seem to be working properly when called from outside DataManager

UI Desired Improvements
- number spinner instead of text box for bets and wins input
  -> should show only allowed values
  -> should update allowed values according to input from other players
- images for "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons
- adapt SingleRound activity to just display Round's FULL info
