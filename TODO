TECHNICAL DEBTS

Refactor it!
* Convert MenuItem's "Magic Numbers" into enums for:
  MatchList
  SingleMatch
  SingleRound

KNOWN ISSUES
* DataManager.saveRound() doesn't seem to be working properly when called from outside DataManager

"GHOST" ISSUES
* intermitent 'SQLiteException: unable to close due to unfinalised statements' upon running test suite (testSaveAnExistingMatchAfterRemovingARound)

TODO for 2nd ALPHA
- improve UI
  * player names should be acquired from user input instead of contacts
  * on-screen buttons instead of menuitems
  * app icon
  * icons for tabs
  * i18n: pt + en
