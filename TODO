TECHNICAL DEBTS

Refactor it!
* Convert MenuItem's "Magic Numbers" into enums for:
  MatchList
  SingleMatch
  SingleRound
* I18n for hard-coded strings

KNOWN ISSUES
* DataManager.saveRound() doesn't seem to be working properly when called from outside DataManager

"GHOST" ISSUES
* intermitent 'SQLiteException: unable to close due to unfinalised statements' upon running test suite (testSaveAnExistingMatchAfterRemovingARound)

Desired Improvements
* Facebook-only contacts still don't get added to Match

TODO for 1st ALPHA
- fix known issues above
