TECHNICAL DEBTS

Refactor it!
* Tests should be cleaned up and standardized concerning what should be in setUp()/tearDown()
* Convert MenuItem's "Magic Numbers" into enums for:
  MatchList
  SingleMatch
  SingleRound

KNOWN ISSUES
* DataManager.saveRound() doesn't seem to be working properly when called from outside DataManager

"GHOST" ISSUES
* intermitent 'SQLiteException: unable to close due to unfinalised statements' upon running test suite (testSaveAnExistingMatchAfterRemovingARound)

TODO for future releases
  * i18n: pt + en
